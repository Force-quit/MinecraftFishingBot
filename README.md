# 🎣 Minecraft Fishing Bot

Automate your Minecraft fishing experience with this easy-to-use fishing bot. This bot, written in C++ using the Qt framework and Windows API, enhances your fishing adventures by intelligently recognizing when a fish is ready to be caught.

## 🚀 Features

- **Auto Fishing:** The bot uses (dumb) image recognition to detect key patterns in the Minecraft game window, such as when a fish is hooked.
- **Runs in the background:** Once the bot is started, you can put it in the background and work on something else.
- **Easy to use:** No complex setup required. Just launch the bot on the Minecraft client and let it handle the fishing for you.

## 🛠️ How to Use
